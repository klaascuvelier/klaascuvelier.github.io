So, I finally finished my second Boxee plugin. This time I can call it a _real_ plugin, there are options, lists and dialogs. Hooray!

The plugin is called &#8220;Vrt Internetradio&#8221;, and it basicly plays internet streams from the VRT (Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie).  
The VRT ¬†owns several radio stations and they provide streams to listen to them via the internet. I took the opportunity to use those to make a Boxee plugin so we all can play them with our beloved Boxee.

There&#8217;s not that much functionality, but I tried to keep the layout simple and tried to give a good user experience (up/down buttons to right controls and such).

Screenshots and download link are below , don&#8217;t hesitate to comment ¬†and help me improve the plugin.
