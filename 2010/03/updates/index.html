    <div class="post">
  <p>It’s been a while I shared something useful with the rest of the world. So for the few people who might read this, here’s why:</p>
<p>I’ve been rather busy with my job. Since August ’09 I’m a full time web developer at Netlog NV (in Ghent, Belgium). It’s a very cool job and I’m in an awesome team. I learn from them everyday. New approaches, techniques, …</p>
<p>Also, In November I’ve won a price together with Cliff Ophalvens, my partner at Netlog during my internship (Now also a colleague at Netlog). Our school nominated our work, so we had to go to Brussel to give a presentation about it.<br>
Out of almost 18.000 graduated ‘Bachelors’, our work won in the category Informatics. Worth mentioning, not?</p>
<p>In my spare time I’m currently working on several little projects, which will probably be shared on the site when I finished them.¬†Of course¬†after a whole day of work, I most of the time don’t go right back to my computer screen… So they’re not quite finished yet.<br>
But here’s a little list of stuff I’m working on (not in real detail):</p>
<ul>
<li>Boxee plugins (I’ve so much ideas at this moment)</li>
<li>Netbeans plugins</li>
<li>Little PHP Framework</li>
</ul>
<p>So, that’s about it. Hope to see you soon again.</p>
