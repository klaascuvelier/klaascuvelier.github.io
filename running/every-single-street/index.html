  <h1>Every Single Street</h1>
<h2 id="intro" tabindex="-1">Intro</h2>
<p>After seeing Rickey Gates' <a href="https://www.everysinglestreet.com/">Every Single Street</a> project, I decided I wanted to do the same for my home city of Ghent, Belgium.</p>
<p>Having primarily resided in Ghent since 2009 (with a brief period in San Francisco from 2016 to 2018), Ricky made me realized that I had yet to truly explore the breadth of my own city. <br >
Motivated by his example, I decided to undertake the same challenge: to run each and every street of Ghent, immersing myself in a quest to create a deeper connection with the city I call home and discover unexplored neighbourhoods.</p>

<h2 id="phase-1" tabindex="-1">Phase 1</h2>
<p>In January 2019 I started running routes through the streets of Ghent. My plan was to cover all streets inside the boundary I set (from the Bourgoyen along R4 to Liedermeerspark, along the Schelde to Ledeberg, R40 to Dok Noord, around the <em>Bloemekenswijk</em> back to the Bourgoyen ), calling it <em>the inner city</em>.</p>
<p>However, due to the non-grid layout of Ghent's street plan, achieving complete coverage proved to be a challenging task. As a result, I typically created hand-drawn routes for each run shortly before embarking on them.</p>
<p>I am not a professional or sponsored runner so my attempt was constrained by family, work and social life. All runs started either from the <a href="https://showpad.com">Showpad HQ</a> during lunch, or <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/gent+dok+noord/">Dok Noord</a> where I lived at the time.
As a result there were be quite some streets I covered multiple times.</p>
<p>On September 14, 2019, I ran a 35km double loop of the city to finish running every single street in Ghent.</p>
<p>Spread out over 48 runs, I ran 632.3km.</p>
<h2 id="phase-2" tabindex="-1">Phase 2</h2>
<p>A while after completing the streets of Ghent's inner city somebody introduced me to <a href="https://citystrides.com">CityStrides</a>. A website that tracks your progress in running all the streets of a city.
After connecting my Strava account I realized I was not the only person running the streets of Ghent and that I definitely did not run <em>all</em> the streets. Completing <a href="#phase-1">phase 1</a> put me around 35% of the total streets of Ghent.</p>
<p>I decided to continue running the streets of Ghent. I am currently still at it, around 62% completion.</p>
<p>To complete all streets, I decided to use all the historical data available on Strava. I also often take my bike to start my run in a different part of the city.</p>
