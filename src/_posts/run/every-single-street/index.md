# Every Single Street

In November 2018 Rickey Gates had the crazy idea to [run all the streets of San Francisco, California](http://www.rickeygates.com/everysinglestreet). About 2,000km of pavement with quite some elevation.
I had been following Rickey for a longer time already as he's a great ultra-runner and inspiring person overall. Given that I lived in San Francisco from 2016 to 2018 myself I was very interested in his journey.

Only 40 days after the start, he finished running all of San Francisco's streets. Incredible!

## Every Single Street &middot; Ghent

Rickey has inspired many more people to start running every single street of the cities they live in, even in San Francisco: [Fifty Shades of Pavement](https://pathprojects.com/blogs/news/running-san-francisco-block-by-block).

> To walk across a place is to truly know a place.

I've been living in Ghent for the most part since 2009 (from 2016 until 2018 I lived in San-Francisco myself) and I realized that I definitely not truly know Ghent. I haven't visited every single neighbourhood.

This inspired me to take on the same adventure Ricky did, but in Ghent.

### Planning

The street plan of Ghent is not a grid like San Francisco's. Covering every single street is not as straightforward as on a grid-based street plan.

I am not a professional or sponsored runner so my attempt is going to be constrained by family, work and social life. My runs are going to start either from the [Showpad](https://showpad.com) office during lunch, or [Dok Noord](https://www.google.com/maps/search/gent+dok+noord/@51.0653089,3.7307443,17z/) where I live. As a result, there will be quite some streets I'll be running multiple times. But let's not bother too much about that.

Currently I am planning my routes using the [Strava](https://strava.com) route builder in combination with the map above to see which streets I've covered. On the road I use [BikeGPX](https://bikegpx.com/) for running the actual route.

### Update

On September 14 I finished running every single street in Ghent. Spread out over 48 runs, I ran 632.3km.
My final run was a 35km [double loop of the city ending at Het Zuid](https://www.strava.com/activities/2707125949).
