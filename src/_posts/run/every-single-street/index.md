# Every Single Street

> To walk across a place is to truly know a place.
> <br/> <small>Ricky Gates</small>

<br/>

In November 2018, Rickey Gates embarked on an ambitious mission to [run all the streets of San Francisco, California](http://www.rickeygates.com/everysinglestreet), covering approximately 2000 kilometers with significant elevation.
Remarkably, he accomplished this feat in just 45 days!

Rickey's remarkable achievement has served as [a powerful inspiration for countless individuals](https://www.everysinglestreet.com/), including myself.

Having primarily resided in Ghent since 2009 (with a brief period in San Francisco from 2016 to 2018), I realized that I had yet to truly explore the breadth of my own city. <br >
Motivated by Rickey's example, I decided to undertake the same challenge: to run each and every street of Ghent, immersing myself in a quest to forge a deeper connection with the city I call home and discover unexplored neighbourhoods.


## Running every street

I am not a professional or sponsored runner so my progress is constrained by family, work and social life.

Originally I put out some deliberate boundaries around the city center, limiting the streets I wanted to run.
All of my runs were 


I finished my last run on ..sfjej;weklw

Later on I was introduced to [CityStrides](https://citystrides.com) and realized I was not the only person running the streets of Ghent and that I definitely did not run _all_ of the streets.

### Planning

The street plan of Ghent is not a grid like San Francisco's. Covering every single street is not as straightforward as on a grid-based street plan.

I am not a professional or sponsored runner so my attempt is going to be constrained by family, work and social life. My runs are going to start either from the [Showpad](https://showpad.com) office during lunch, or [Dok Noord](https://www.google.com/maps/search/gent+dok+noord/@51.0653089,3.7307443,17z/) where I live. As a result, there will be quite some streets I'll be running multiple times. But let's not bother too much about that.

Currently I am planning my routes using the [Strava](https://strava.com) route builder in combination with the map above to see which streets I've covered. On the road I use [BikeGPX](https://bikegpx.com/) for running the actual route.

### Update

On September 14 I finished running every single street in Ghent. Spread out over 48 runs, I ran 632.3km.
My final run was a 35km [double loop of the city ending at Het Zuid](https://www.strava.com/activities/2707125949).
