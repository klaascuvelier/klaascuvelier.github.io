# I run faster than a SF Cable Car

I am writing this in 2023, but this post is about the period I resided in San Francisco, from August 2016 until July 2018.

A while after moving to San Francisco I found out that [A Runner's Mind](https://arunnersmind.com/) was holding monthly races against the SF cable car on Hyde street. The top speed for a cable car is about 15km per hour (9.5 miles per hour).

I joined about 5 times and was consistently faster then the cable car. A couple of times I was even the fastest of the joiners, which landed me a pair New Balance shoes ðŸ¥³.

I also used to hold the KOM on the [Hyde St Cable Car Race segment](https://www.strava.com/segments/10076515) until recently. Losing it made me realize I actually had that KOM.

**Some action photos:**
