<h1>Klaas Runs</h1>

<section>
    <p>After playing soccer for about 20 years I turned into a runner. It took me a while to really start enjoying it, but now I thoroughly do.<br />
        I mostly enjoy running in mountains and forests, but can also appreciate a good city run, especially combined with some fun elements like chasing the cable car, running every single street, running art, ...</p>
    <p>I tried to document some things I did, hoping it might inspire to do similar things and enjoy running as much as I do.</p>
