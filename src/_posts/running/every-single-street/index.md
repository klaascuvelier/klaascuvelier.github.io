# Every Single Street




## Intro

After seeing Rickey Gates' [Every Single Street](https://www.everysinglestreet.com/) project, I decided I wanted to do the same for my home city of Ghent, Belgium.

Having primarily resided in Ghent since 2009 (with a brief period in San Francisco from 2016 to 2018), Ricky made me realized that I had yet to truly explore the breadth of my own city. <br >
Motivated by his example, I decided to undertake the same challenge: to run each and every street of Ghent, immersing myself in a quest to create a deeper connection with the city I call home and discover unexplored neighbourhoods.

## Phase 1
In January 2019 I started running routes through the streets of Ghent. My plan was to cover all streets inside the boundary I set (from the Bourgoyen along R4 to Liedermeerspark, along the Schelde to Ledeberg, R40 to Dok Noord, around the _Bloemekenswijk_ back to the Bourgoyen ), calling it _the inner city_.

However, due to the non-grid layout of Ghent's street plan, achieving complete coverage proved to be a challenging task. As a result, I typically created hand-drawn routes for each run shortly before embarking on them.

I am not a professional or sponsored runner so my attempt was constrained by family, work and social life. All runs started either from the [Showpad HQ](https://showpad.com) during lunch, or [Dok Noord](https://www.google.com/maps/search/gent+dok+noord/) where I lived at the time. 
As a result there were be quite some streets I covered multiple times.  

On September 14, 2019, I ran a 35km double loop of the city to finish running every single street in Ghent. 

Spread out over 48 runs, I ran 632.3km.

## Phase 2 
A while after completing the streets of Ghent's inner city somebody introduced me to [CityStrides](https://citystrides.com). A website that tracks your progress in running all the streets of a city.
After connecting my Strava account I realized I was not the only person running the streets of Ghent and that I definitely did not run _all_ the streets. Completing [phase 1](#phase-1) put me around 35% of the total streets of Ghent.

I decided to continue running the streets of Ghent. I am currently still at it, around 62% completion.

To complete all streets, I decided to use all the historical data available on Strava. I also often take my bike to start my run in a different part of the city.
