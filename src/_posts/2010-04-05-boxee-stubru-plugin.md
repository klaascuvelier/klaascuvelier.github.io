So &#8230; I finally finished my first Boxee plugin. Funny tough, it&#8217;s non of my previously planned plugins.  
Today I got the inspiration to make ¬†a small but handy plugin. [Studio Brussel][1] was airing &#8220;De zwaarste lijst&#8221;, a list of hard rock and metal music tonight, and I thought it would nice to listen to it with Boxee because it uses my Logitech Z-5500. &#8216;Nuff said right?

So here it is. It&#8217;s extremely basic, but it does what it was supposed to do, play stubru music.  
Download and enjoy!

Tested on Boxee Beta for OSX and Ubuntu.
