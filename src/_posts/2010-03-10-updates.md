It&#8217;s been a while I shared something useful with the rest of the world. So for the few people who might read this, here&#8217;s why:

I&#8217;ve been rather busy with my job. Since August &#8217;09 I&#8217;m a full time web developer at Netlog NV (in Ghent, Belgium). It&#8217;s a very cool job and I&#8217;m in an awesome team. I learn from them everyday. New approaches, techniques, &#8230;

Also, In November I&#8217;ve won a price together with Cliff Ophalvens, my partner at Netlog during my internship (Now also a colleague at Netlog). Our school nominated our work, so we had to go to Brussel to give a presentation about it.  
Out of almost 18.000 graduated &#8216;Bachelors&#8217;, our work won in the category Informatics. Worth mentioning, not?

In my spare time I&#8217;m currently working on several little projects, which will probably be shared on the site when I finished them.¬†Of course¬†after a whole day of work, I most of the time don&#8217;t go right back to my computer screen&#8230; So they&#8217;re not quite finished yet.  
But here&#8217;s a little list of stuff I&#8217;m working on (not in real detail):

- Boxee plugins (I&#8217;ve so much ideas at this moment)
- Netbeans plugins
- Little PHP Framework

So, that&#8217;s about it. Hope to see you soon again.
