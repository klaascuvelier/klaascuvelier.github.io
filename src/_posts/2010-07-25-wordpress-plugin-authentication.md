**Update:** This plugin is no longer maintained, as I don't use Wordpress anymore myself.

So, I finally submitted my first plugin to the WordPress plugin base.

It&#8217;s a plugin which add functionality to request visitors authentication before the website can be viewed. It doesn&#8217;t use HTTP Authentication, just php and html.  
You can choose to use the WordPress authentication functionality to login, or give a password yourself.

Try it out, and give some feedback.
