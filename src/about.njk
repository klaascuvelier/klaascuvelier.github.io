<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I am Klaas Cuvelier.</P>

<p>After graduating in 2009 with a degree in <em>Applied Informatics</em> and completing an internship at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netlog" rel="noopener">Netlog</a>, I joined Netlog as front-end web-developer.
In 2012, I became one of the founding engineers at <a href="https://showpad.com" rel="noopener">Showpad</a>, where I currently serve as a principal software engineer in the Developer Platform Team.</p>

<p>In addition to my passion for software development and technology, I also enjoy spending time outdoors, particularly through running and hiking. I have documented some of my experiences on <a href="/running">my running page</a>.</p>
