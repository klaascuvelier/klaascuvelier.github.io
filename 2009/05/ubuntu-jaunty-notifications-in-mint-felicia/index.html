  <p>As some of you might already have seen, Ubuntu Jaunty Jackalope has a new popup notifier, called ‘notify osd’.<br>
It looks, in my opinion, much like Mac OS X’s Growl which I like very much (I’ve been using OS X for over 3 months now at Netlog NV) so I decided to try and install it on my Mint desktop and laptop at home.<br>
Apparently some people already managed to install it in Ubuntu Intrepid and because Mint Felicia is based on Intrepid, I thought it would be a peace of cake following their instructions. Turned out it wasn’t. I had to install much more stuff to get it working and that’s why I’d like to share it.</p>
<p>First of all, these instructions below are based on two tutorials I found using Google, namely http://www.stefanoforenza.com/how-to-get-the-new-notifications-on-intrepid/ and http://blog.alexrybicki.com/2009/02/how-to-install-notify-osd-in-intrepid.html. Also, this is what I had to do to get it working, it is possible this won’t work for you.</p>
<p>So, let’s get started.<br>
First of all, you’ll have to install a bunch of needed files:</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 11px">
  $ sudo apt-get install bzr gnome-common automake gconf2 libgconf2-4 libgconf2-dev libdbus-glib-1-dev libwnck-dev mono-gmcs libnotify-dev
</p>
<p>The package bzr (short for ‘bazaar’) is needed to get the source from launchpad.<br>
Next step is actually getting the source:</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 11px">
  $ bzr branch lp:notify-osd
</p>
<p>Just to make sure you have it right, LP, first char is an ‘L’ ;-)<br>
Before we can start compiling, we’ll have to fix something (I had to do it, not sure you’ll need to):<br>
To successfully complete the build, the command ‘gmcs’ is needed. As you might have noticed, we installed the packet above, but for me that wasn’t enough. Apparently installing that package creates a file in /usr/bin named ‘gmcs2′ instead of just ‘gmcs’.<br>
I fixed this by making a softlink:</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 11px">
  $ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gmcs2 /usr/bin/gmcs
</p>
<p>So, we can start compiling now, as always, first run the ‘autogen’ script followed by the ‘make’ command:</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 11px">
  $ cd ~/notify-osd<br /> $ ./autogen.sh<br /> $ ./make
</p>
<p>If you have errors, it’s probably a dependencies problem, on both of the mentioned sites above they advised to make install some more packes:</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 11px">
  $ sudo apt-get install libc6 libcairo2 libdbus-1-3 libdbus-glib-1-2 libgconf2-4 libglib2.0-0 libgtk2.0-0 libpango1.0-0 libpixman-1-0 libx11-6
</p>
<p>Installing above packets wasn’t necessary for my, but it might be for you.<br>
So, when you don’t have any errors (anymore) it means your build was successful, and so you can start using the new notification pop-ups.<br>
First of all, you’ll have to end the current notifier and then you’ll be able to start notify-osd like this:</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 11px">
  $ killall notification-daemon<br /> $ cd src<br /> $ ./notify-osd
</p>
<p>Now to the check out your new notifier, you can run the test script in the same directory (you’ll have to open a new tab because notify-osd is still running):</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 11px">
  $ ./send-test-notification.sh
</p>
<p>This show a whole bunch of nice pop-ups, demonstrating the possibilities of notify-osd.</p>
<p>Just like me, you might like this notifier very much, and you’d like to have this running the next time you start up you’re machine.<br>
As we didn’t make any permanent changes to the system, and the default notifier will be started when you restarted your system, we’ll have to write a little script to fix this:</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 11px">
  $ touch ~/notify-osd/startup.sh<br /> $ nano ~/notify-osd/startup.sh
</p>
<p>Using the editor (nano) add these lines to the file:</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 11px">
  #!/bin/bash<br /> killall notification-daemon<br /> sleep 1<br /> ~/notify-osd/src/notify-osd
</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 11px">
  Now all you have to do is make the script runnable and add the script to you&#8217;re startup scripts in ~/.config/startup:
</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 11px">
  $ sudo chmod a+x ~/notify-osd/startup.sh<br /> $ touch ~/.config/startup/notify-osd.desktop<br /> $ nano ~/.config/startup/notify-osd.desktop
</p>
<p>This what you should put in the file (replace [USER] with your username):</p>
<p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 11px">
  Type=Application<br /> Name=notify-osd<br /> Exec=/home/[USER]/.config/autostart/notify-osd.sh<br /> Icon=system-run<br /> Comment=<br /> X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=tru
</p>
<p>This worked out for me, I hope it does for you too!</p>
