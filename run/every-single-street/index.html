  <h1>Every Single Street</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>To walk across a place is to truly know a place.
<br/> <small>Ricky Gates</small></p>
</blockquote>
<br/>
<p>In November 2018, Rickey Gates embarked on an ambitious mission to <a href="http://www.rickeygates.com/everysinglestreet">run all the streets of San Francisco, California</a>, covering approximately 2000 kilometers with significant elevation.
Remarkably, he accomplished this feat in just 45 days!</p>
<p>Rickey's remarkable achievement has served as <a href="https://www.everysinglestreet.com/">a powerful inspiration for countless individuals</a>, including myself.</p>
<p>Having primarily resided in Ghent since 2009 (with a brief period in San Francisco from 2016 to 2018), I realized that I had yet to truly explore the breadth of my own city. <br >
Motivated by Rickey's example, I decided to undertake the same challenge: to run each and every street of Ghent, immersing myself in a quest to forge a deeper connection with the city I call home and discover unexplored neighbourhoods.</p>
<h2 id="running-every-street" tabindex="-1">Running every street</h2>
<p>I am not a professional or sponsored runner so my progress is constrained by family, work and social life.</p>
<p>Originally I put out some deliberate boundaries around the city center, limiting the streets I wanted to run.
All of my runs were</p>
<p>I finished my last run on ..sfjej;weklw</p>
<p>Later on I was introduced to <a href="https://citystrides.com">CityStrides</a> and realized I was not the only person running the streets of Ghent and that I definitely did not run <em>all</em> of the streets.</p>
<h3 id="planning" tabindex="-1">Planning</h3>
<p>The street plan of Ghent is not a grid like San Francisco's. Covering every single street is not as straightforward as on a grid-based street plan.</p>
<p>I am not a professional or sponsored runner so my attempt is going to be constrained by family, work and social life. My runs are going to start either from the <a href="https://showpad.com">Showpad</a> office during lunch, or <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/gent+dok+noord/@51.0653089,3.7307443,17z/">Dok Noord</a> where I live. As a result, there will be quite some streets I'll be running multiple times. But let's not bother too much about that.</p>
<p>Currently I am planning my routes using the <a href="https://strava.com">Strava</a> route builder in combination with the map above to see which streets I've covered. On the road I use <a href="https://bikegpx.com/">BikeGPX</a> for running the actual route.</p>
<h3 id="update" tabindex="-1">Update</h3>
<p>On September 14 I finished running every single street in Ghent. Spread out over 48 runs, I ran 632.3km.
My final run was a 35km <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2707125949">double loop of the city ending at Het Zuid</a>.</p>
